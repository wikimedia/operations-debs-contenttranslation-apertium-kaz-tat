* corpus.kaz.txt
	All Kazakh stories and texts I have been working so far.

* corpus.tat.txt
	Postedited Tatar translation of the corpus.

* kaz-tat-origina.txt
	Translation of corpus.kaz.txt with the second to last revision of apertium-kaz-tat.

* kaz-tat-nova.txt
	Translation of corpus.kaz.txt with the last revision of apertium-kaz-tat.

* tat-kaz-origina.txt

------

Basic workflow is like the following (IS talking to himself):
	1) run diff on kaz-tat-origina.txt and corpus.tat.txt,
	2) see what is to fix/to improve,
	3) fix them and compile,
	4) run ./qa kaz-tat-corp to see whether you really fixed them,
	5) commit,
	6) mv kaz-tat-nova.txt kaz-tat-origina.txt
	
	repeat the cycle

'qa kaz-tat-corp' in apertium-kaz-tat/ gives a coloured diff of "origina" and "nova" translations.

The same workflow applies for the opposite direction.
